To build the Bitcoin message signing and verification functionality into a web app, I'll provide a complete, self-contained Python web application using Flask (a lightweight web framework). This app will have a simple HTML frontend with forms for signing and verifying messages. It runs locally on your machine (e.g., via python app.py), and you can access it in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.Key Notes:Security: This is for educational/local use only. Never expose this app to the internet or handle real private keys on a public server, as it could lead to key exposure. In production, signing should happen client-side (e.g., in JavaScript) to keep private keys secure.
Dependencies: Only Flask (install via pip install flask) plus the built-in Python modules from the original code. No other extras needed.
Features:Home page with links to sign or verify.
Sign page: Input message and private key (hex), get Base64 signature and derived address.
Verify page: Input message, signature (Base64), and address; get verification result.

How to Run:Save the code below as app.py.
Install Flask: pip install flask.
Run: python app.py.
Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.

Extensions: You could add JavaScript for client-side validation or deploy to a platform like Heroku (but again, security first).

Complete Code for app.py (see code doc)

This integrates the original signing/verification logic directly into the Flask routes. Test it with the example from before (e.g., private key 18e14a7b6a307f426a94f8114701e7c8e774e7f9a47e2c2035db29a206321725, message "message", address "1GAehh7TsJAHuUAeKZcXf5CnwuGuGfH2eq"). If you need enhancements like CSS styling, client-side JS, or porting to another framework (e.g., Django or Node.js), let me know!
